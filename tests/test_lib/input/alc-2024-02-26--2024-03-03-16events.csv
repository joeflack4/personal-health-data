The dream I dreamt the most about, I'd call ""What did Taro do wrong?"". I was in a car with some people, including one of my favorite political commentators, Krystal Ball. We were stopped because in front of us was a raggedly looking young white man in a white T shirt and jeans, basically pulling a truck along past an intersection, like on a big rope. Something was pulling it from the front, and he was assisting by pulling it in the midsection. The truck was diagonally positioned, with one set of wheels on the ground and one set in the air. Me and someone else got out of the car to help him. He set the car down. Then, there suddenly a plain wooden table on the ground, and this man started doing meth, his drugs strewn about the table. There was also strangely like a lamp or model of his head on the table with like an open mouth.
Somehow the scene changed to where I was inside of a house that was owned by some kind of syndicate. They were asking about Krystal Ball. Finally we had what done what we needed to there and left. When I went back to the car, it was now a bus and there were tons of other people there, mostly kids. But apparently we too were a gang / syndicate. Apparently while I was gone, we had captured a boy from the other syndicate we were just at. His name was Taro. Krystal Ball changed into some other similarly aged woman, a bit more heavyset, who came off as an abrasive person. I didn't like her. She wanted to punish Taro because he stole one of our credit cards. But I thought it was unjustified that we needed to punish him since he was just a kid. The woman and I had a debate over leadership; whether I could lead; whether I had the guts to do ""what was needed"". She said something like ""remember Armin?"". It was a strange example. This is a character from Attack on Titan, and supposedly at some point he had disrespected me. I got a flashback in my memory about it. I conceded that I am generally a lenient person, but argued that when it matters, and when it is called for, I can do the tough things. We then had like a trial for Taro, and Phil was there, and surprisingly he was on the anti-Taro side and he was telling a story. I ultimately interrupted and said ""What did Taro do wrong?"" Phil looked at me dumbfounded and didn't say anything. I repeated, raising my voice, and asked again ""What did Taro do wrong!?"". It seemed like I'd won the day, because they didn't have a sufficient explanation for why he should be punished. So the trial was to be dismissed and he was to be released. But there was some grumbling and people started to leave the courtroom. I realized I had had a political win here, but I didn't have the respect of this group generally, even from the people who didn't want to punish Taro. It reminded me of when I was a teacher, and there were certain classes where I did not do a good job with discipline, and I unfortunately had lost the respect of some of the students. As people were leaving, I asked for a raise of hands--even though Taro was to be released--for those who thought this was correct, and those who thought he should be punished. About half of the room raised their hands agreeing with the release. And then the only people to ""raise their hands"" were 4 individuals. Only they weren't present. Instead, there were pictures of them on the wall, and the indicator on whether they were raising their hands was a lighting around along the border of the picture that would light up green if they voted yes, or red for no. When I asked if he should be punished, 4 of them lit up green. One of them was my old boss, Staci. And two of them were an ugly monster; the same exact picture of the same ugly monster.
In another, short dream, I was watching a character who was being talked into having sex, and in return he could get the position of ""director"" at his workplace. I think it was inspired by some movie I was watching.
In another dream, I was playing Palworld with Chirag and John, neither of whom actually had the game. I suppose I was dreaming about this because I was going to see them in real life the next day. And also they were the last people I played video games with last week before I prepared for my ski trip. In the dream, we were crossing a river. Chirag attacked a mammoth, which promptly did a back swipe with his tail and one shot him. Chirag resurrected and had to walk all the way back. I told him that normally he should 'res', but in these instances, when I was a ""power leveler"", it was better to let me res him. There were lots of chests and journal pages scattered through the area to be picked up / opened. John was telling me about the build he was going for; that he was going to run a ""quality build"". And I mentioned that I was going to do magic enchanting on my weapon. However, these builds don't exist in Palworld; they exist in Elden Ring, an expansion of which I just recently heard is coming out soon.",,
2/27/2024 17:09:33,他,,,,,,,,,,"Poor mood one out of five. A little surprising because I just got back from vacation and I had a great vacation and I'm also happy to be back. I think it must be because of the depressive effects of alcohol from the last few days. Or it could be poor sleep the last few days, but the sleep wasn't that bad. And this doesn't feel entirely like that either. There's probably something I haven't gone through in my head that is causing this. Maybe it's because Ashley got depressed yesterday and cried and we're not going to be moving and I've been pressuring her too get a job and that's just causing some stress and hardship. That's probably the biggest factor but I don't know",,

3/3/2024 15:38:45,他,,,,,,,,,,"Dream log. I dreamt that Ashley and I were in a land that looked like the show ""Made in Abyss"". It was like a lush strange land of floating islands and strange creatures. In the show, you descend into a massive crater to get there. In my dream, it was a land of floating islands several miles up.
Before the abyss part of the dream, this dream is fragmented but I found myself with Phil and my friend Shen. I was in a bedroom, on a laptop. Then Shen and I were talking about something. He was engaging in some kind of competition. We went to a vending machine and he got like a donut, and I was either saying that I'd pay for it for him but also I was considering eating some of it. I guess he'd paid with cash because change came out of the machine, but it was a strange, large amount of cash, like all kinds of different coins, from pennies to the rare half dollar; probably like $10 of mixed change came out.
We walked back up the stairs and Shen went to his room, saying he was taking a nap. I went back on my laptop.
Then the dream moved to some other scene where I was in a car with Dad and probably Phil. We were outside of a bar. He had to get something, and I also had to go inside to fill up my water bottle. I did this thing that I often do at such fountains where I fill the bottle up, drink half of it, and fill it again. I think this dream morphed into the Abyss dream, and that's where we were driving.
When it got to the Abyss part of the dream, I was on a floating island and observing several birds and other animals like flying squirrels. We were impressed with one hawk, who caught a draught and floated up to a very tiny floating rock and was perched there.
Later, I was sleeping in the remains of a wrecked car, and Ashley was sleeping nearby. There was a person or body there, and it started to twitch. It was a zombie, coming to life. It started to chase me. I wanted it to get away from Ashley, so I jumped off of the island and it jumped with me. I saw that below me was a massive urban industrial zone. There were massive walls like dams around the city, hundreds or thousands of feet high, and I tried to descend towards the wall and press my hands against it as I was falling to hopefully slow my fall. I don't know how eventually I got to the ground without dying, but I did. I found myself in a shop. I was trying to find supplies to help me get back up to the abyss, but I didn't know what to buy. I got a backpack, and some kind of weird land mine with a coil around it, and I was looking for other stuff, but the store was closing. I told some people about my predicament walking with them, hoping that they would help me, but they found it hard to believe me. One kid seemed to believe me, and walked with me until I found some other industrial building that looked like it could be helpful to me, and I bid him adieu there. Around that time, I woke up.",,
