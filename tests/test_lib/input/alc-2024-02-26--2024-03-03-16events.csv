I got more sleep last night and it seems good quality I feel both awake and refreshed, but also I feel simultaneously a little blanket of grogginess, and a light headache from having 2/3 of a glass of wine right before I went to sleep. I also wore my nose plug which helped with breathing but I think I was snoring a little bit and my neck was also hurting so I woke up a few times. Mental energy wise I feel mostly refreshed but just very slightly scatterbrained and I do feel my physical energy is a little lower than it should be and I'm a little more sore than I should be in my muscles from exercises that didn't feel as well as they could have perhaps",,
